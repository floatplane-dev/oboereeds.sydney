          <h2>Hi I'm Madeleine</h2>
          <p>I made this site to sell professional quality oboe reeds to my students and their friends in Australia</p>
          <p>Students and their parents often have questions about reeds when starting the oboe. This website is intended to help!</p>
          <p>Using a reed which is misshapen or of poor quality materials makes learning and playing the oboe harder!</p>
          <p>Science has not yet figured out how to make high quality reeds from synthetic materials, and natural materials don't travel well between temperature and humidity changes</p>
          <p>Our Beginner reeds are shaped slightly differently to make them even easier to play your first notes on the oboe</p>
          <p>Our Intermediate and Professional Reeds are shaped to balanced the effort between all kinds of notes</p>
          <p>Although all our reeds use the highest quality Le Roseau Chantant cane, our Professional reeds are made from the most perfect materials recieved in each batch</p>
