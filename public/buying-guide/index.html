      <h3>What is an oboe reed?</h3>
      <p>
        An oboe reed is the apparatus one blows into to sound their instrument.
        Instruments such as the clarinet, saxophone, bassoon and oboe all use
        reeds to produce their sound. The clarinet and saxophone are single
        reeded instruments, the oboe reed is particularly special as it is a
        double reed. Single reeded instruments are required to place their reed
        on a mouthpiece to play however, double reeded instruments vibrate
        against themselves producing sound without the aid of a mouthpiece.
        Double reeds are far more delicate than single reeds and require finer
        craftsmanship to produce.

      <h3>European vs. American</h3>
      <p>
        There are two main schools of reed making - the European and American.
        The main difference between these two schools is their differing scrape
        styles. The ‘scrape’ of a reed refers to where a reed maker has scraped
        or carved into the reed. The American scrape (used across America) runs
        the entire length of the reed. Scraping to this degree is thought to
        make a lighter, easier reed. However, this lightness of the reed
        sacrifices the tone colour or sound of the reed and has often been
        referred to as sounding ‘duck like’. The European scrape (used in
        Australia and throughout Europe) only scrapes half of the reed not the
        entire length. This leaves more cane on the reed and in turn produces a
        more beautiful, dark, rich tone. The question then is, are European
        reeds more difficult to play? The simple answer is no. A quality reed
        maker will scrape a European style reed in a shape that allows for
        vibrations to travel easily, without resistance through the reed. The
        tip is carved to be paper thin and allows for easy blowing.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important to know the difference between these two types of reeds
        when purchasing. The techniques used to play these reed types differs
        and students should not be changing between the two styles. Especially
        in their early learning phases as it will alter their establishing
        embouchure (mouth formation on reed). In Australia the European scrape
        is used. You will not see any professionals using anything else!

      <h3>Climate and Natural Materials</h3>
      <p>
        The main component of a reed is the cane. This is produced from the
        plant Arundo Donax, a tall perennial cane and a relative to bamboo.
        Because such a large component is made from a natural material no two
        reeds are the same. This also makes reeds especially vulnerable to
        differing climates and weather conditions. Many professional oboists
        carry their reeds in cases that specifically monitor the humidity and
        adjust this to their optimal conditions. To further this; when traveling
        overseas professional oboists will often craft completely new reeds on
        location to accommodate the change in climate. It is because of this
        change that having reeds produced locally and in a similar climate is
        important. What works in one country may not work in another. Next time
        it rains, see if your reeds have absorbed the extra water in the air and
        hardened.
